This is a simple To-Do List application developed solely based on C++ Object Oriented Programming.
This application contains 5 different features, i.e., inserting, viewing, updating, deleting and searching for the tasks. 
The application uses file handling to store the tasks in a single file and the same is used for all other features. A new file is created everytime the user runs the simulation.
